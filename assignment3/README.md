	-assignment3.html: html version of jupyter notebook
	-assignment3.ipynb: jupyter notebook exploring data and producing results/plots step by step
	-donors_choose_report.pdf: pdf report explaining results to a policy audience

	-projects_2012_2013.csv: data used for prediction task

Note: The report does not include the full tables. Where the report references an appendix, one should look at files called "final_tables.csv" and "final_tables_6mo_2.csv".
